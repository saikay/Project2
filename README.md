By: Casey Shore, Joshua Moore, Glory Avina, Case Griffiths (The Trash Pandas)

## Overview
This project uses API calls and a login system to push data to a SQL database and provide end users with the ability to search for food recipies based on what is in their fridge at any given time. For example, if a user only has cheese and potatos in their fridge, the recipie finder will search out and pull back baked cheese potatoes.
